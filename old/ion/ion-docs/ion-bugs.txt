====================

       also it kills any scrollback buffer.
       I am looking into this.

--[ Release 0.1.20 ]--

 - Build did not complete due to filesystem error

--[ Release 0.1.19 ]--

 X fb: at 3am Aug 30th, it appears that 0.1.19 was done building
   the /proc directory is still listed there taking up space
   and will give tar fits.  Just an FYI that i saw it there,
   donno if it will disappear or not.

   jb: ** fixed /proc issue by adding umount to chroot script,
          was being auto-mounted by some make installs!!

--[ Release 0.1.18 ]--

 - Release bombed due to problem with binutils

--[ Release 0.1.17 ]--
 
 - Release bombed due to missing 2.4.21 config

--[ Release 0.1.16 ]--

 - Release bombed due to problem with broken 2.4.21 config

--[ Release 0.1.15 ]--

 X ./build.sh: line 216: unexpected EOF while looking for matching `"'
   ./build.sh: line 218: syntax error: unexpected end of file

 X iproute2

 X yafc missing



--[ Release 0.1.14 ]--

All of these issues were manually fixed in chroot environment
before final release of 0.1.14. Need to fix before building
next release. 

 X fb: When building 260test3 on ion, make modules bitched bout
   depmod.  need symlink from /usr/sbin/depmod to /sbin/depmod

 X fb: Problems with stock ION 2.6.0-test3 kernel
       EXT3 is missing
       Unix domain sockets is needed by sysklogd
        Because it is missing, sysklogd bitches at bootup

 X tar 1.13 fails to build because of a bug with
   tests/genutils.c on line 165. Need to add a patch
   before compiling that removes the fputs code on line 165.

 X iproute2 does not build because there is no kernel
   linked to /usr/src/linux. Need to symlink the 2.4.x kernel
   to /usr/src/linux. It requires the kernel be built, so
   we will have to build a false generic kernel so that this
   is satisifed before trying to compile.

 X chroot-b script needs to remove /shared

 X logs need to be in /tmp (for chroot-a/b output)

 X need to automated called chroot-a / chroot-b

 X script needs to automatically place the proper ION release
   in /etc/ion files.

 X missing libdb4 (db4-)

	cd build_unix
	../dist/configure --prefix=/usr
	make
	make install

The following was NOT done to 0.1.14:

 * scripts/extract-ikconfig

 X add a script to auto-test the completed distribution,
   should check for the existance of all necessary files.

	chroot /ion/release/0.1/14 /usr/bin/env -i \
	 HOME=/root TERM=$TERM PS1='\u:\w\$ ' \
	 PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin:/shared/bin \
	 /bin/bash --login

 * missing host (use http://www.weird.com/~woods/projects/host.html)

 X iptables in /usr/local

 X missing /boot files :

	fix:

		lilo build do:

			make all
			make boot-menu.b
			make boot-text.b
			make boot-bmp.b
			
			make install

			cp boot-*.b /boot
			cp chain.b /boot
			cp os2_d.b /boot

			ln -s boot-text.b /boot/boot.b

		create lilo.conf:
